How did you make sure the program will guess the number in fewest number of tries?

I gave the count of min, max, and mid of the number 1 - 100, and designed in such a way that it asks a number if it is no then it asks whether its greater than certain no as so on it continues asking and will find the exact number.


How did you make program keep asking user if they would like to keep playing until they say "no"?

I inserted nested if and else statements in order to continuation of game, untill the user says no, as soon as the used says no it will be guessing the numbers.

import math
def guess_number(min,max,count,mid):
    count=count+1
    if mid>100:
        print("The number cannot exceed 100")
        return count
    answer=input("Is it "+str(mid)+" ? (yes/no) ")
    if answer == "no":
      greater=input("Is the number larger than "+str(mid)+" ? (yes/no) ")
      if greater=="yes":
         return guess_number(mid+1,max,count,math.ceil((mid+max)/2))
      else:
         max=mid-1
         return guess_number(min,max,count,math.floor((max+min)/2))
    else:
        return count
name=input("Hi, What is your Name ")
print("Hello "+name+"! Lets play a game!\nThink of a random number from 1 to 100,and I'll try to guess it!")
min=1
max=100
play_more="yes"
while play_more=="yes":
    if play_more == "yes":
        result=guess_number(min,max,0,(min+max)//2)
        print("Hey! I got it in "+str(result)+" tries!")
        play_more=input("Do you want to play more? ")
    else:
        play_more="no"
print("Ok Bye, Have a great day!â€‹")

In 1-3 sentences, explain your approach for solving program 2 in Homework 2 (shuffle the string).

I used for loop in iteration of statements where it can shuffle the string with initialization, condition and increment or decrement.

string=input("Enter string : ")
lst=[]
print("Enter array of length "+str(len(string))+"")
for i in range(0,len(string)):
    ele=int(input("indices["+str(i)+"] : "))
    lst.append(ele)
new_string=list(string)

for i in range(0,len(lst)):
    for j in range(i+1,len(lst)):
        if(lst[i] > lst[j]):    
            temp = lst[i]    
            lst[i] = lst[j]    
            lst[j] = temp

            temp2=new_string[i]
            new_string[i]=new_string[j]
            new_string[j]=temp2

print("Output: "+str("".join(new_string)))
